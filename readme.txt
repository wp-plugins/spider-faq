== Description ==  
  
###Spider  [WordPress FAQ](http://web-dorado.com/products/wordpress-faq-plugin.html)  
  
Spider FAQ allows you to provide the users with a well-designed and informative FAQ section, which can significantly decrease the amount of user inquiries on various issues. The Spider FAQ plugin is highly customizable and is one of the best FAQ tools that can be found in WordPress plugin directory. It offers a big number of built-in themes, as well as allows creating new themes from scratch. FAQs usually contain questions/answers on various topics and generally, especially when the number of questions is big enough, it is necessary to somehow organize them to make it easier for the users to navigate and locate the answers they had been seeking for. For that very reason, Spider FAQ allows creating different categories to be able to organize the questions accordingly. It is also possible to include standard categories (e.g. an existing post category) into the set of FAQ categories.
